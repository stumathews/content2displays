The primary motivation behind this project is to describe a system which will represent key desirable characteristics of presentation software that will be used to show case events, advertising and general information for show in public areas. This would be primarily used as a marketing tool. An example of using such a system is a large screen television showing PowerPoint slideshow presentation such as South Bank Royal festival hall.
